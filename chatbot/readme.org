#+TITLE: Chatbot code

These subprojects are releated to the chatbot library.

* Core
The low level contains the basic data structures and some drool rules that 
act upon that.
Think parsing the user utterance for example in to symbols.

* File reader
The file reader uses lowlevel datamodel to construct the database.

* Personality
High level provides structure and rules to do high level deliberation.
We encoded personality into this.
