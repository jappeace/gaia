#+TITLE: Chatbot code

These subprojects are the chatbot library.
The file reader is seperated from the core because it just deals with YAML.
Which then gets put into the model described by the core.

The entire core is driven by drool rules.
To see how this is used please look at the reference implementation.

* Core
Contains the rules, personality and the model (data structures) of the chatbot.

* File reader
The file reader uses lowlevel datamodel to construct the database.

* License
Both these are LGPL
