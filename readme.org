#+TITLE: Gaia chatbot

This is a chatbot that can have varied respones depening on personality.

Origanlly based upon the `salve' architecture, we moved away to a yaml based
one.

* Done
+ ScalaJS + Akka http in gradle
+ copied source code over from old maven build
+ Connect akkahttp server to drools chatbot
+ Delete drools about sp and such (Not really used, also copyrithgt stuff)
  + Make sure git fame says pracitcally 0 lines are from manuel
  + Copy to a new repository so that we don't commit infringement on history

* TODO todo
+ Make a proper readme that describes what this chatbot does.
  + Difference from ALICE (both images)
  + The mapping with connections
  + List possible advantages
  + Eventually tell for the detailed description there is the thesis
+ Fix the horible client layout.
  + Could make an auto logon (on page load)
  + Enter text below and messages that are older moving up
    (it just seems unatural pushing older messages down.)
