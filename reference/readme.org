#+TITLE: Gaia reference implementation

This sets up an akka actor server that delivers a webpage.
The webpage then is connected trough a websocket with the server. 
From the webpage user can send messages that are send trough the websocket to
the server, server then sends the messages to drools,
and drools finally can send messages back.

I just modified [[https://github.com/jrudolph/akka-http-scala-js-websocket-chat][this project]] to work with the chatbot.

If you want to make a different implementation all the interesting code is in
the BotFace file of the server.
